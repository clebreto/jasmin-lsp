# Require File Navigation - Implementation Summary

## Feature Overview

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

This feature allows developers to navigate directly to included Jasmin source files by using "Go to Definition" on the filename in a `require` statement.

## Usage

In any Jasmin file with a `require` statement:

```jasmin
require "math_lib.jazz"
```

1. Place your cursor on the filename string (`"math_lib.jazz"`)
2. Right-click and select "Go to Definition" (or press F12, or Cmd+Click)
3. The editor will open `math_lib.jazz` at the top of the file

This works for:
- ✅ Simple require statements: `require "file.jazz"`
- ✅ Multiple requires: `require "file1.jazz" "file2.jazz"` 
- ✅ Namespaced requires: `from NAMESPACE require "file.jazz"`

## Implementation Details

### Location in Codebase

**File:** `/jasmin-lsp/Protocol/LspProtocol.ml`  
**Function:** `receive_text_document_definition_request`

### How It Works

1. **Detect Context**: When a goto definition request comes in, check if the cursor is on a `string_literal` or `string_content` node

2. **Check Parent**: Walk up the tree-sitter AST to check if the string is inside a `require` node

3. **Resolve Path**: Extract the filename from the string and resolve it relative to the current file's directory:
   ```ocaml
   let current_dir = Filename.dirname current_path in
   let resolved_path = Filename.concat current_dir filename in
   ```

4. **Verify File Exists**: Check if the file exists at the resolved path

5. **Return Location**: Return an LSP Location pointing to line 0, column 0 of the target file

### Code Structure

```ocaml
(* Helper: Check if node is inside a require statement *)
let rec is_in_require_statement node =
  match TreeSitter.node_type node with
  | "require" -> true
  | _ -> 
      match TreeSitter.node_parent node with
      | None -> false
      | Some parent -> is_in_require_statement parent
in

(* Helper: Resolve file path relative to current document *)
let resolve_required_file current_uri filename =
  let current_path = Lsp.Uri.to_path current_uri in
  let current_dir = Filename.dirname current_path in
  let resolved_path = Filename.concat current_dir filename in
  
  if Sys.file_exists resolved_path then
    Some (Lsp.Uri.of_path resolved_path)
  else
    None
in

(* In the main handler *)
if (node_type = "string_literal" || node_type = "string_content") 
   && is_in_require_statement node then
  (* Handle require file navigation *)
  let filename = TreeSitter.node_text content_node source in
  match resolve_required_file uri filename with
  | Some target_uri -> Ok (Some (`Location [location])), []
  | None -> Error "Required file not found", []
else
  (* Standard symbol-based goto definition *)
  ...
```

## Testing

### Test File

**Location:** `/test_require_navigation.py`

### Test Results

```
============================================================
Testing: Goto Definition on require Statement
============================================================
Main file: test/fixtures/main_program.jazz
Expected target: test/fixtures/math_lib.jazz

Found require statement at line 3, char 14
Line content: require "math_lib.jazz"

Sending LSP requests...
✓ Got response from LSP
✓ Response points to math_lib.jazz

============================================================
TEST PASSED: Require file navigation works!
```

### Integrated Test Suite

Added to `test/run_tests.py` as **Test 8: Navigate to Required File**

```
============================================================
Test 8: Navigate to Required File
============================================================
✅ Goto definition on require statement (navigates to required file)
```

## Path Resolution

The feature uses **relative path resolution** based on the directory of the current file:

```
Current file: /project/src/main.jazz
Require:      require "lib/utils.jazz"
Resolves to:  /project/src/lib/utils.jazz
```

This matches typical Jasmin project structures where libraries are organized relative to source files.

## Error Handling

- **File not found:** Returns error "Required file not found"
- **Parse error:** Falls back to standard symbol resolution
- **Invalid path:** Logs error and returns failure

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
```ocaml
Io.Logger.log "Cursor is on a require statement string";
Io.Logger.log (Format.asprintf "Attempting to resolve required file: %s" filename);
Io.Logger.log (Format.asprintf "Resolved to: %s" target_uri);
```

## VS Code Integration

Once the LSP server is configured in VS Code's Jasmin extension, this feature works automatically:

1. Open a Jasmin file with `require` statements
2. Hover over the filename in the require
3. Ctrl+Click (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Click (macOS) on the filename
4. File opens instantly!

Alternative methods:
- Right-click → "Go to Definition"
- Place cursor on filename and press F12
- Use "Peek Definition" (Alt+F12) to preview the file inline

## Benefits

### 1. **Faster Navigation**
Jump between files instantly without manually opening them

### 2. **Better Code Understanding**
Quickly inspect library code to understand function signatures and implementations

### 3. **Refactoring Support**
Easily navigate to dependencies when refactoring multi-file projects

### 4. **IDE-like Experience**
Brings Jasmin development closer to the experience of modern IDEs for languages like TypeScript, Rust, or Go

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:

1. **Absolute Path Support**: Handle absolute paths in require statements
2. **Search Path Configuration**: Support configurable include directories
3. **Namespace Resolution**: Better handling of `from NAMESPACE require` syntax
4. **Wildcard Imports**: Support for pattern-based requires if added to language
5. **Circular Dependency Detection**: Warn about circular require dependencies
6. **Go to Symbol in Required File**: After jumping to file, immediately show symbol picker

## Related Features

This feature complements other cross-file capabilities:

- **Cross-File Goto Definition** (Test 6): Jump to function definitions across files
- **Cross-File References** (Test 7): Find all usages of symbols across files
- **Document Store**: Tracks all open files and their parse trees
- **Symbol Table**: Maintains cross-file symbol information

Together, these features provide a complete multi-file development experience for Jasmin projects.

## Comparison to Other Languages

| Language | Syntax | LSP Support |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| C/C++ | `#include "file.h"` | ✅ clangd |
| Python | `import module` | ✅ Pylance |
| TypeScript | `import { x } from './file'` | ✅ TypeScript LSP |
| Rust | `mod file;` | ✅ rust-analyzer |
| **Jasmin** | `require "file.jazz"` | ✅ **jasmin-lsp** |

Jasmin now has feature parity with mainstream languages for include file navigation!
