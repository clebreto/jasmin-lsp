"""
Test transitive dependency resolution.
This tests that symbols defined in transitively required files can be found.

File structure:
- base.jinc: defines BASE_CONSTANT
- middle.jinc: requires base.jinc, defines MIDDLE_CONSTANT
- top.jazz: requires middle.jinc, uses BASE_CONSTANT (from base.jinc)

The test verifies that when in top.jazz, hovering/goto on BASE_CONSTANT works
even though base.jinc is not directly required by top.jazz.
