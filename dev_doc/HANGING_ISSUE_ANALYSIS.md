# LSP Server Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## All Issues Fixed!

### 1. **Missing Error Response Handling** ✅ FIXED
Error responses are now properly sent instead of being silently swallowed.

### 2. **macOS dyld Library Loading Crash** ✅ FIXED
Library uses `@rpath` instead of hardcoded `/usr/local/lib` path.

### 3. **Tree-Sitter Integration** ✅ FIXED

**Problems Found and Resolved:**

#### A. Version Mismatch
- pixi was installing libtree-sitter 0.26 with tree-sitter-cli 0.25.6
- Caused TSLanguage struct layout incompatibility
- **Fix**: Locked both to 0.25.* in pixi.toml

#### B. C Stub Pointer Extraction Bug
- `Language_val(v)` macro was casting instead of dereferencing
- Caused random memory to be read as language pointer
- **Fix**: Changed `(TSLanguage *)` to `*((const TSLanguage **))`

#### C. Hardcoded Library Path
- tree-sitter-jasmin Makefile used absolute path
- **Fix**: Changed to use `@rpath/lib$(LANGUAGE_NAME).$(SOEXT)`
